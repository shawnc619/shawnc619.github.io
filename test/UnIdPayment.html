                <h5>1.  Direct Debit Service Agreement (“DDSA”)</h5>
                <p>
                    If you have elected to pay by direct debit or credit card payment, either by internet or phone, by completing the bank account or credit card details on the Account Details Form, you request and authorise Macquarie, until further notice in writing, to debit the bank account or credit card nominated on the Account Details Form, any amounts which Macquarie (User ID 077380) may debit or charge you on behalf of your Biller. You acknowledge that:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>it is your responsibility to ensure that your financial institution allows payments to be processed from your account via Direct Debit Request ("DDR"). If your financial institution does not process DDRs from your account, you must advise Macquarie immediately. You may incur fees as a result of nominating an account that does not permit DDRs;</li>
                        <li>by accepting this DDSA you authorise Macquarie to debit your bank account or credit card for any payments initiated by you and any fees and charges that may be associated with the processing of your payment. This could include and not be limited to a transaction fee or surcharge for processing your payment and government taxes (including a Goods and Services Tax);</li>
                        <li>your financial institution may, in its absolute discretion, at any time by notice in writing to you, terminate the direct debit arrangement as to future debits;</li>
                        <li>either party may, by giving three (3) days written notice to the other party, vary the timing of future debits;</li>
                        <li>you can stop or cancel future debits at any time by giving Macquarie or your financial institution three (3) days notice in writing;</li>
                        <li>if at any time you believe that a direct debit against your bank account or credit card is inappropriate, erroneous or incorrect it is your responsibility to notify Macquarie as soon as possible;</li>
                        <li>it is your responsibility to ensure that there are sufficient cleared funds in your bank account (or sufficient credit available on your credit card) to meet debits, and Macquarie may cancel the DDSA on three (3) days written notice if two (2) payments are dishonoured because of insufficient funds (or declined credit card transactions) within a 12 month period. Macquarie may charge the cost of dishonoured payments against your bank account or credit card as detailed in clause 3(c);</li>
                        <li>(in the case of a bank account direct debit) Macquarie may need to pass on details of your DDR to its sponsor bank in the Bulk Electronic Clearing System to assist with the checking of any incorrect or wrongful debits to your nominated account;</li>
                        <li>acting responsibly, Macquarie may vary the DDSA from time to time without prior notice to you. The latest version of the DDSA and any changes to fees and charges are published on the DEFT Payment Systems website. Should a variation be materially adverse to you, Macquarie will notify you. If you do not accept the varied DDSA, you must contact your Biller directly to arrange alternate payment arrangements;</li>
                        <li>any direct debit that is scheduled to occur on a day that is not a Business Day will occur on the following Business Day. If you are uncertain as to when a debit will be processed, you should enquire with Macquarie;</li>
                        <li>this DDSA does not form part of any other agreement or contract under which you may be contractually bound including, but not limited to, any contract or residential tenancy lease;</li>
                        <li>we provide the DDSA to you as an optional payment service that is not intended to restrict you from using other methods of payment;</li>
                        <li>provision of the DDSA is contingent upon your Biller (the business or entity to whom you are making your payment) being registered to use DEFT as a Macquarie client. If your Biller ceases to be a client of Macquarie, then Macquarie may immediately terminate the DDSA and any future payments set up by you;</li>
                        <li>all fees, charges and applicable taxes for your payments will be displayed prior to each payment being confirmed by you. The amount payable plus the applicable fee (as at the date of payment) and GST will be debited from your nominated account (or credit card) as a single amount. For example, a payment of $300.00 plus transaction fee of $0.85 (including GST) will result in a debit to your nominated account or credit card of $300.85;</li>
                        <li>fees and charges may change without notice and are non-refundable;</li>
                        <li>if a direct debit is dishonoured, the transaction will be reversed and a charge for the cost of the dishonoured direct debit may be applied against your account by your financial institution. Your Biller may also be charged a dishonour fee by Macquarie for reversing the transaction. It is at your Biller's discretion whether this dishonour fee is charged to you. To the extent permitted by law, Macquarie is not responsible for any fees charged to you by your financial institution or other third parties as a result of payments failing or dishonouring.</li>
                        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">it is your responsibility to check payments have been successfully debited from your bank account or credit card.</span> Macquarie will not actively notify you if your payment is unsuccessful.</li>
                    </ol>
                <h5>
   2.  Representations</h5>
                <p>
                    By using DEFT you acknowledge that you:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>have read and understood the DDSA and the Terms of Use and that you are contractually bound by the DDSA (if applicable);</li>
                    <li>understand the fees and charges that may apply to using DEFT; and</li>
                    <li>have entered into the DDSA contract with Macquarie (if applicable) of your own free will and have in no way been required to enter into this contract by any landlord, real estate agent or any other person with whom you may be contractually bound, either under a residential tenancy lease or any other contract.</li>
                </ol>
                <h5>
   3.  Refund Policy</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Transaction Amount</span><br />DEFT acts as a transactional aggregator and sits between the Payer (you) and the Biller (the organisation to whom you are making the payment and being the client of Macquarie). <span style="font-weight: bold;">Macquarie does not have authority to reverse or refund authorised transactions. You must contact your Biller directly for a refund or reversal.</span> Your Biller has absolute authority to refund your transaction. Your Biller is the organisation who has issued you with your DEFT Reference Number.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Transaction Fees and Surcharges</span><br />Transaction fees and surcharges that are charged to your credit card or bank account for facilitating a DEFT transaction are non-refundable as this is a cost incurred by Macquarie for processing the transaction. Transaction fees and surcharges are collected through DEFT. The Biller to whom you are making your payment has elected to pass these fees and surcharges on to you.<br />Where you believe any transaction fee or surcharge has been charged in error you should request a refund by either:
                        <ol>
                            <li>writing to DEFT Payment Systems, 1 Shelley Street, Sydney NSW 2000; or</li>
                            <li>emailing <a href="mailto:help@deft.com.au">help@deft.com.au</a>, and include a full explanation of your situation. Macquarie will generally reply within two (2) Business Days.</li>
                        </ol>
                        All requests for refunds must be made within 30 days of the original transaction being processed.
                    </li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dishonour Fees</span><br />Dishonour fees may be charged by your financial institution in the event Macquarie is unable to debit your nominated account for your payment. As an example, you may have had insufficient funds in your account to process your DEFT transaction. Your Biller may be charged a dishonour fee by Macquarie for the reversal and dishonour of the transaction from your Biller's account. In the event of such dishonour fees being charged by either your financial institution or your Biller, Macquarie is not in a position to refund these fees. <span style="font-weight: bold;">You should contact your financial institution or your Biller if you feel any dishonour fee has been incorrectly or unfairly processed.</span></li>
                </ol>
                <h5>
   4.  Deleting or Changing Your Payment and Account Details</h5>
                <ol>

                    <li>Payments due today can not be deleted or changed, only future dated payments can be changed or deleted. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Please note that cancelling payments is your responsibility and not that of your Biller.</span> For example, if you vacate your rental property and no longer require future payments, failure to cancel may result in ongoing payments, fees and charges.</li>
                </ol>
                <h5>
